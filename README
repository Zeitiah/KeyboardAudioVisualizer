This program has a few problems: the audio is faster and higher pitched then normal, the visualization doesn't look good, and I think the current way of changing the LEDs is
slightly inefficient. 
TO DO:
	Change from measuring pitch, to measuring frequency
	Fix pyaudio problems mentioned above 
	Rewrite how the LEDs change state
